Please implement the following adjustments to the BookMyFarm frontend (continuing from the last round). Reuse existing components and state logic, and deliver clean React/TypeScript code with zero ESLint/TS errors.

### 1. Search Availability UI  
- **On “Search Availability” click**: hide the top video section and the “3 Farms Picked by Us” section; display only:
  1. Your existing search form (alias autocomplete + dates + guests).  
  2. The “List Properties” results panel on the right.  
- **Otherwise** (no search): show in order:  
  1. Featured video carousel  
  2. “3 Farms Picked by Us”  
  3. Happy customer reviews  

### 2. “Add Your Farm” Section in Results Panel  
- Above the results list, insert a call-to-action card: **“Can’t find your perfect farm? Add yours!”**  
- Clicking it navigates to `/owner/register`.  
 - **Form structure & order** exactly as listed (with `*` required fields):  
     1. Farm Owner Name *  
     2. Farm Owner Mobile Number * (validate 10-digit)  
     3. Farm Owner Email * (validate email)  
     4. Farm Name *  
     5. City * (text)  
     6. Nearby Area * (text)  
     7. Person Limit * (number; show note “extra charge applies”)  
     8. Guest Stay Capacity (Day) * (number)  
     9. Guest Stay Capacity (Night) * (number)  
    10. Farm Size in Sq yd * (number)  
    11. Extra Person Charge on Weekdays * (currency)  
    12. Extra Person Charge on Weekends * (currency)  
    13. 12-Hour Price Weekday * (currency)  
    14. 24-Hour Price Weekday * (currency)  
    15. 12-Hour Price Weekend * (currency)  
    16. 24-Hour Price Weekend * (currency)  
    17. Check-In Time * (dropdown of 12-hour clock, AM/PM)  
    18. Check-Out Time * (same 12-hour dropdown)  
    19. Caretaker Name *  
    20. Caretaker Number * (validate phone)  
    21. Farm Address * (multi-line)  
    22. Farm Facilities * (multi-select checkboxes)  
    23. Location Link * (validate URL)  
    24. Property Rules * (multi-line)  
    25. Swimming Pool Size (text)  
    26. Kids Swimming Pool Available? (yes/no toggle)  
    27. Referral Code (optional)  
    28. Upload Property Photos * (up to 10 images/videos, max 10 MB each)

   - **Calendar & Time inputs**: use the same React calendar component for date/time where applicable; ensure the 12-hour dropdown is consistent across all pages.  
   - **Validation**: Show inline errors for required fields and format mismatches.  
   - **File Upload**: allow multiple selection, preview thumbnails before upload, enforce count/file-size limits.

### 3. Booking Flow  
- For each farm result, add a **“Book Now”** button.  
- On click, open a dummy payment modal with three states: **Processing**, **Success**, and **Cancelled**.  
  - No real Razorpay integration—just mock the flow and callbacks.  
  - After **Success**, navigate to `/booking/confirmation`; on **Cancelled**, show an inline error banner.

Deliver each change as modular React components, reuse calendar and autocomplete, manage UI state via existing hooks or context, and ensure styling consistency with Tailwind/CSS modules. Let me know if you spot any build errors or need further clarifications!
